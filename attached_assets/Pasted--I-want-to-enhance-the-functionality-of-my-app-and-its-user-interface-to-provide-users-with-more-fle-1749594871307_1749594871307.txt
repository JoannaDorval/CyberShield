"I want to enhance the functionality of my app and its user interface to provide users with more flexibility and capability. Specifically, I want the app to allow users to select the type of document they will input â€” either a Threat Model, Block Diagram, or Both. Additionally, users should be able to choose the source for cross-referencing examples: MITRE EMBED, MITRE ATT&CK, or Both.

If the user selects MITRE EMBED as the source, the app should prompt them to fill out a predefined list of properties related to Device Properties (e.g., hardware, system software, application software, and networking). The properties should follow the structure provided below:

Device Properties:
Hardware:

PID-11: Device includes a microprocessor.
PID-12: Device includes Memory/Storage (external to CPU).
[Full list of properties under Hardware as specified above.]
System Software:

PID-21: Device includes a bootloader.
PID-22: Device includes debugging capabilities.
[Full list of properties under System Software as specified above.]
Application Software:

PID-31: Application-level software is present and running on the device.
PID-311: Device includes the usage of web/HTTP applications.
[Full list of properties under Application Software as specified above.]
Networking:

PID-41: Device exposes remote network services.
PID-411: Device exposes remote services with the ability to send, receive, view, or modify sensitive information or configurations.
[Full list of properties under Networking as specified above.]
Once the user selects the input type and cross-referencing source, the program should automatically cross-compare the input document with the selected source (MITRE EMBED, MITRE ATT&CK, or both). The app should then generate an Excel spreadsheet as the output document, with the following structure:

Expected Functionality
Dynamic User Interface:

Allow users to choose the input type and cross-referencing source (Threat Model, Block Diagram, or Both; MITRE EMBED, MITRE ATT&CK, or Both).
If MITRE EMBED is selected, prompt users to fill out the Device Properties list with detailed fields (provided above).
Automated Cross-Referencing:

Parse the input document (Threat Model, Block Diagram, or Both) and compare its elements against the selected source (MITRE ATT&CK, EMBED, or both).
Automatically populate the relevant fields in the Excel spreadsheet based on the cross-referencing results.
Excel Output Generation:

Generate an Excel spreadsheet with the structure outlined above.
Pre-fill known fields based on the cross-referencing process, leaving unknown fields blank for user review.
Robust Error Handling:

Validate user input and provide clear error messages if the input document is missing required information.
Ensure the app handles edge cases gracefully, such as incomplete or conflicting data.
Scalability:

Ensure the app is scalable and can handle large input documents and extensive cross-referencing with MITRE ATT&CK and EMBED frameworks.
Implementation Notes for Replit Agent
Use libraries such as pandas or openpyxl to generate and manipulate Excel spreadsheets.
Parse input documents using appropriate file-reading libraries (e.g., xml.etree.ElementTree for XML, json for JSON-based threat models, or other parsing tools as required).
Use the MITRE ATT&CK and EMBED frameworks for cross-referencing. If available, integrate their APIs or use local datasets in JSON/CSV format for offline functionality.
Design the user interface (UI) to be intuitive, with dropdown menus for document type and cross-referencing source selection, and dynamic fields for MITRE EMBED property input.
