"Make the following changes to my codebase to enhance functionality and workflow:

1. UI Enhancement
Add scrolling capability to the user interface to ensure all buttons and interactive elements can be accessed, even if the content exceeds the screen size.
2. Input Handling
Update the program to accept the following types of inputs:

Threat Model: Input files with a
.tm7
extension.
Asset List: Input from an Excel spreadsheet.
Mitre Embed Questionnaire: Allow users to directly interact with Mitre's embedded questionnaire within the UI.
3. Workflow Update
Modify the workflow to perform the following steps:

If a Threat Model or Asset List is provided as input:
Parse the input file and map its properties to Mitre Embed properties.
Integrate the parsed data with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Cross-reference all known threats with MITRE ATT&CK information.
Generate a comprehensive threat report based on the cross-referenced data.
If the Mitre Embed Questionnaire is selected:
Allow direct mapping and integration of user responses to MITRE ATT&CK framework properties.
4. TARA Document Generation
Implement functionality to allow users to generate a TARA (Threat Assessment and Remediation Analysis) document based on the threat report.
Populate the TARA document with relevant information in the format of the Excel spreadsheet provided earlier.
5. Desktop Application Compatibility
Ensure all changes are implemented and tested to work seamlessly in the desktop version of the application.

Make sure the code changes are modular and properly documented to facilitate future maintenance and updates."

Tips for Execution:
Break Down Tasks: Begin by updating the UI for scrolling functionality, then move on to input handling, workflow changes, and TARA document generation.
Test Incrementally: Test each feature as it is implemented to ensure functionality and compatibility with the desktop version.
Use Clear Documentation: Add comments to explain how each part of the code works, especially for new features.
