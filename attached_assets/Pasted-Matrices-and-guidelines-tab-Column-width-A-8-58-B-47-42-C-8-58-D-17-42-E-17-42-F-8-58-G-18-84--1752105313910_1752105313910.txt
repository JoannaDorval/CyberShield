Columb B -row 2 should say Asset identification processIn black Calibri Bold font size 12 #9BC2E6 center justified . row 3 should say Determination of security property loss in calibri bold 11 with a E2EFDA back ground center justified
Line 4 should say negligibile impact in calibri 11 left justified
Line 5 should say Non negligible impact in calibri 11 black left justified
There should be an outline around b2b3b4b5  and individually around cell be and b3 should also be outlined more boldly. The rest of the column should have no lines of separation it should just be white. 
Columb C – no lines just blank and white
Column D through AD line 2 should be merged and should say Threat analysis and risk assessment in black bold Calibri 12 center justified with a #FFD966 back ground 
D and E should be merged on line 3 and say Impact analysis -category values in calibri 11 bold center justified with a back ground color #F2F2F2  D4 should be labled Impact category in calibri 11 bold center justified with a #F2F2F2   background and E4 should also have a #F2F2F2   background with a lable Impact value in calibri 11 bold center justified. D5 lable is Negligible D6 Moderate D7 Major and D8 severe. E5 0 E6 1 E7 3 E8- 5 . on line 11 columbs d through k should be merged and labeled Threat analysis and risk assessment in black bold calibri 12 and the background should be #FFD966 .D and E should merge on line 12 and be labled Attack potential – attack vector in calibri 11 bold center justified with a #C6E0B4 back ground. D/e 13 should be labled Physical, D/E 14 Local D/E15 Adjacent and D/E16 network. D/e 12-D/e 16 should have a black boarder and/e 12 should have a border as well. Next to it on line 12 GHI should merge and say Attack feasibility center justified #C6E0B4 background with a valibri eleven bold black font. Below that on line 12 G should say impact level H Values from and I values to with the same background color font and center justified. Under impact level line 14 G should say High, G15 Medium, G16 Low, G17 very low. H14 should say 0 h15 should say 14  h16 should say 20 and H17 should say 25 . I 14 should say 13 I 15 should say 19 I 16 should say 24 I 17 should say 1000 all should be center justified and calibri 11 none bold black font. In column k starting on line 12 there should be the title Cybersecurity goals and claims in calibri 11 bold center justified and underneath it Risk treatment decision with the same formatting #EDEDED background for both k14 says Avoid the risk k 15 Reduce the Risk k16 Share the risk and k 17 Retain the risk. All those should be in calibri regular black font center justified. That whole section should be outlined in black bold. Above it columns k -t should be merged on line three and say Attack potential – category values with the #C6E0B4 color background and calibri bold 11 center justified. Line 4 starting with k should be titled Elapsed time then Value then Specialist expertise then Value then Knowledge of the item or component then Value then Window of opportunity then Value then Equipment then Value. Those are formatted the same as the header attack potential category values. Column K starting on line vie should e less than or equal to sign 1 day, less than or equal to 1 week, less than or equal to 1 month, less than or equal to 6 months and k9 should say greater than sign 6 months in the L column under Value it should be 0,1,4,17,19 M5 Layman M6Proficient, M7 Expert M8 Multiple experts and in the N column next to it starting on N5 should be ),3,6,8. Under knowledge of the item or component Line O5 should say Public, O6 should say Restricted o7 confidential O8 Strictly confidential. The values column next to it P should read 0,3,7,11. Q5 should say Unlimited Q6 should say Easy Q7  Moderate and Q8 Difficult/None. In the values column next to it in R it should say 0 in R5 then 1,4,10 down to R10. S5 Should say Standard S6 Specialized S7 Bespoke and S8 Multiple bespoke and the values column next to that should say 0,4,7,9. Each section should be outlined with its value column so k and L, Mand N O and P Q and R S and T. 
Line 3 column V-AD should merge and be titled Risk evaluation in calibri eleven bold center justified with the #C6E0B4  background color The headers underneath it are as follows lines 4 and 5 v and w should all be merged and there is no writing. Then line 4 x-aa should be merged and titled Attack feasibility rating. X5 should say Very low y5 Low z5 Medium AA5 High. In column V the lines 6-9 should merge and Impact rating should be centered in the box. Then in w6 Severe w7 Major w8 Moderate and W9 Negligible. Those titles form a matrix with the #C6E0B4  background color and calibri 11 bold black center justified font. The values of the matrix are as follows x6 2 x7 1 x8 1 x91 y6 3 y7 2 y8 2 y9 1 z6 4 z7 3 z8 2 z9 1 AA6 5 AA7 4 AA8 3 AA9 1. All the numbers in the matrix are calibri 11 bold black center justified. If its value is 2 th back ground color is #70AD47 if the value is 3 the back ground color is #FFC000 if the value is 4 the background color is #BF8F00 and if its five the background color is #FF0000
For columns ac and ad line 4 shouold be merged and titled Risk value mapping with #C6E0B4   back ground then column ac should be right justified and starting with AC5 the values should be 1,2,3,4,5 ending with ac9. For AD should be left justified calibri 11 bold and staring at AD5 should be labled Very low, Low, Medium, High, Critical for low the background color is #70AD47 medium background color should be #FFC000 for high the background color is #BF8F00 and critical should be #FF0000
For line 11 V-AA merge the cells and the background color is #FFD966the title is Threat analysis and risk assessment in calibri 11 bold center justified. For line 12 V-AA should be merged and titled Risk threshold level background color is #C6E0B4  in for line 13 and 14 v and w merge all cells and no titles or words there but background is #C6E0B4   then line 13x-AA should be merged and say Attack feasibility rating center justified and background color #C6E0B4  then lines 15-18 in column V should be combined and say Impact rating with a background color of #C6E0B4  and column w starting with 15-18 should say Severe, Major, Moderate, Negligible with background color #C6E0B4  x14 should say Very low Y14 should say Low z14 should say Medium and AA14 should say High all with a background of #C6E0B4  column x 15-18 should all say Below in calibri 11 with a background color of #70AD47 x18-aa18 should also say Below with a background color #70AD47 then Y15 16 and 17 z15 16 17 and aa15 16 and 17 should all say Above and background color #FFC000
For line 20 V-AA merge the cells and the background color is #FFD966 the title is Threat analysis and risk assessment in calibri 11 bold center justified line 21 v-aa merge cells and label CAL determination center justified and background color #C6E0B4   then line 22 and 23 columns v and w merge and background color #C6E0B4   but no words included. Column v lines 24-27 should be combine and in there say Impact rating column w24 should say Severe W25 Major W26Moderate and W27 Negligible. All background color #C6E0B4  then line 22 x-aa merge cells and title Attack vector with background color #C6E0B4  and line 23 x should say Physical Y23 Local z23 Adjacent aa23 Network all with background color #C6E0B4   in column x starting 24-27 should say 2, 1, 1, -. In y 24-27 the cells should say 3,2,1, -. Z 24-27 should say 4,3,2,- aa24-27 4,4,3, - if the cell is a 2 background color is #70AD47 if the value is 3 the background color is #FFC000 and 4 the background color is #FF0000
