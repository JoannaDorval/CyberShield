Please apply the following updates and fixes to the app:

1. **Asset Configuration Logic**:
   - Replace current behavior with a toggle: the user must either:
     a) Upload a **threat model file** (`.tm7` or `.tb7`)  
     OR  
     b) Complete a **MITRE EMB3D questionnaire** form.
   - Ensure **only one of the two paths** is active at a time. If a threat model file is uploaded, the EMB3D form should be disabled, and vice versa.

2. **MITRE EMB3D Questionnaire UI Fixes**:
   - Add a **"Clear All Fields"** button that resets every input in the questionnaire form.
   - Ensure form state fully resets including dropdowns, checkboxes, and text inputs.

3. **File Upload Validation**:
   - Accept only `.tm7` and `.tb7` file extensions in the threat model upload.
   - Display a validation error if the file extension is not supported.

4. **Remove "Analysis Framework" Section**:
   - This section is no longer needed and should be completely removed from the UI and logic.
   - The backend logic should automatically route everything through both **MITRE EMB3D** and **MITRE ATT&CK** once either input path is provided.

5. **Unified Flow**:
   - Regardless of whether data is from a threat model or the questionnaire, the app should:
     - Extract or infer threats and assets.
     - Cross-reference with MITRE EMB3D.
     - Map related items to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
     - Generate a **TARA Excel report**.

6. **Template Output Fix**:
   - The current output (attached: `TARA_Excel_Report_20250617_170348.xlsx`) does **not** match the desired format.
   - Use the second file (`TARA Template V0001.xlsx`) as the **gold standard for formatting**, including:
     - Column structure
     - Styles (headers, borders, colors)
     - Field naming and ordering
     - Any formulas or static fields

7. **Scroll Wheel Bug**:
   - Fix the scroll behavior so that users can scroll the full app interface with a mouse wheel (e.g., ensure `overflow-y: auto` or scrollable containers are implemented correctly).

8. **Template Generation Fix**:
   - Review the logic that generates the Excel file and refactor it to strictly follow the structure from `TARA Template V0001.xlsx`.
   - If necessary, use an Excel manipulation library that allows you to copy cell styles, formats, and headers from a template (e.g., `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter` with a base file).

The final product should give the user a clean path to either upload a model or use a guided form, and in both cases generate a high-fidelity Excel TARA report in the V0001 format.
